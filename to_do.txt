add nice error handling func for tdmslib

Maybe?
add "triggeredBy" to task info and write it to the tdms file info. Use in processing to figure out method of alignment of timestamps?
Not needed if wf_start_time is good between trigged channels

Fix matlab start time field. First val not getting updated?
