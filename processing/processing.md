# Goals

* Read tare data
* Read experiment data
* Subtract tares
* Apply calibrations
* Extract statistics
  * Stats include mean, median, min, max, and std
  * 1-, 2-, and 10- minute stats - don't let averages cross gaps in time where data isn't collected
  * Average for each file
  * Per -13:
    "10.2 Fundamental load quantities
The basic product of a measurement loads campaign is the calibrated and validated time
series data. However, these time series shall be post-processed to provide summary
statistics, damage equivalent loads and cumulative rainflow spectra to provide an index to the
actual data sets.
For the fundamental load quantities (Table 9), the following shall be computed for all normal
operation data sets:
    * the 10-minute file statistics (minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation);
    * the binned 10-minute statistics for each wind speed bin of the capture matrix;
    * the 10-minute damage equivalent load for a single fatigue exponent;
    * the cumulative rainflow spectrum for all normal operation data sets."
